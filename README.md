# TaskBar

This is a menuTool for mac
![demo](./static/readme/8.png)

## why

When we have some custom shortcut scripts, we need a quick way to use them. Start a Terminal is a kind of way but it is not convenient.

so i make this app, it will give us a menuBar in mac, just add your command and use.
